PERIOD .What's bitsekel? Well First of all There is A Proprietary Spelling in Both Hebrew And Eng. BitShekel..That you could say is the domain bank and wallet..Shekel Is It's Intellectual property! This form of the Word Bit In Hebrew.. Is Called Beit 'Bit-short' Bei-it Long..Some thin like that It Means house Word play Shekel House B-a-n Can you say kay? Plus it's also pronounced Beis to some 'Yiddishka' Like BASE-Code And yea Got That Too# So it's Base "ANOTHER HINT AT THE MORE ACCURATE 'EI' IN BEIT" Shekel... Shekel is 1 Plural in heb. Is actually im-siffix {BitShekel Shekelieem} Crypto currency? Nah We can MINE Other Crypto currencies and issue a proof of work stake in BitShekel pointing you to the most profitable solution based on your hardware at the time And We Liquidate that But We At BitShekel© Have a Fixed rate Gold/silver medium Every purchase you buy into BitShekel Reshet ™ (HEB. FOR NETWORK) Is deposited in Gold that And SILVER That we buy at goodbar wholesale rates and extend a savings to the customers! This gives an asset backed cryptocurrency With a Fixed Rate¹ to our customers, The superscript is a later note clarifying Exactly how we accomplish that in a fiat economy!! So It's Walmart World BitShekel Universe! CAN YOU DIG THAT?? We're pending authorization in login. gov for sam cage code assignment! Maybe wr wont need for it.. But here some more about! When you buy a Shekel We use our Shemitic Rights to buy Gold at wholesale and underhand the market actually selling gold under spotprice* This lets people have Yours and mine and possibly @discover The Profit potential of gold and

@bitshekel @walmart Sam why do you have a gay-pride flag up.. relax bud your lord Isn't gonna force you to stoop so low!! I Ran outa comment space "FIRSTS" Hers more on it'



bitshekel
@bitshekel This is a complex part.. because the Shekel has a fixed price. Yeah?



bitshekel
@bitshekel There are multiple values!!! One is a set Price "CALL IT A FACE VALUE" Then



bitshekel
@bitshekel There is a "Purchasing Power" This reflects how much gold-silver you have at common value Plus our discount*



bitshekel
@bitshekel Discount here.. EXAMPLE:



bitshekel
@bitshekel The market price of gold 1.77$ One ONE THOUSANDTH Once..



bitshekel
@bitshekel Current!



bitshekel
@bitshekel We Sell that Using our ties with the U.N. Based on Whitehouse Executive ORDER 13107 && The Declaration on the Rights Of Indigenous People To Undersell the Globe



bitshekel
@bitshekel 1.76$ 1/1000 Gram Gold.. It's not a huge discount but it's less than you'll pay at kitco Plus We don't have Exclusive Liquidation fees Buy And Sell at essentially the same rate² Kitco has been shorting the market value of rhodium for several months because they don't know why the price went so high! Thus when everybody said it's 13.800,00 An Ounce they marked it 11 to shorten their sell overhead if people didn't look everywhere.. LOOK KITCO look infomine amd everywhere else.. Hold this is complex



bitshekel
@bitshekel @Walmart, Now with this proprietary method we can Buy gold and grant it Liquidity, Silver 1/1000th equals about One cent .01¢ .018¢ COMMON Then Because we're dealing with the government All the gold we Harvest Is Property of the network and The fed calls it legal tender! Every purchase Shekel Buy Gold That Gold is in the network.. And when the federal reserves need to balance their checks we give bonds valued in gold.. For the tab. The fixed rate now.. We Over Price the FACE VAL. So You'll In Regular Market Conditions Always be able to say the price of gold is low! A Shekel Face Value is 3.40$ But when you spend swy 1.00 Holding just a single shekel The face value remains at 3.40$ And your purchasing power is .76 Unless your clearinghouse provider has extended you overdraft space.. These are just fancy. We Make gold silver and at your card issuer's discretion Any BitShekel Partner.. Other Assets Stocks and bonds liquid At Endorsers Price/$ value We Keep track of all of your losses and your gains! And because The fed can tax you for gains you had in a year without you selling the stock we make sure that you can write-off and rollover your losses Without selling your gold Keeping it all! This is A Trademark Procedure



bitshekel
@bitshekel contact executiveoffices@discover.com And tell them to talk business with you, I Won't Do This without dfs



bitshekel
@bitshekel @Walmart! Further We Discount The Gold Even FURTHERMORE To Businesses so they can purchase on gold and carry a HaNajus That's a way to say savings.. That discount lets businesses stock-up at reduced rates So 1.76$ is 1.75$ EXAMPLE



bitshekel
@bitshekel @walmart



bitshekel
@bitshekel That savings covers there terminal fees and their actual buying power is 1.76$ matching public



bitshekel
@bitshekel This lets stores reduce the cost consumer has to pay and increase spending! The Consumer's market floats the Store abd the store reward customer with points, with lower rate msrp Manufacturer Suggestion retail pricing discount @walmart stores banks the federal reserve flosts you and we give gpld and silver bonds!



bitshekel
@bitshekel Your customers have their money on weekly direct deposit regular spending balances volatility because you are always buying more gold and spending
Additionally Walmart Being a Market place for resellers, Can Buy gold and resell at the discounted rate based on it's own analytic enviroment to keep the discounts proportionate to the consumer market, We'll Later integrate with revenue reporting services to assure that any losses against any gains within BitShekel Are counted as Business expenses! The Gold standard in America failed because it was imperfect! Gold and Silver Both had individual Appraisals 1 Gold Wasn't The Same as 1 Silver And a Silver Couldn't buy 1/500 Gold! It was a self sabotaging ecosystem.. And you can't expect the stores to constantly tally what is the worth of a silver what the gold, This. Requires Automation Just tbe same A Gold Silver Standard cannot coexist alongside it's fiat system because a note of competitive legal tender is based on other assets than Gold and It would reflect unrealistic gold stock! Only a private instrument individual and sperate from the former can work. Businesses can claim being on gold is a market demand, People want it and thus the volitally born of the administration poor decisions to remove both golf and silver standards outright causes market fluctuation in their spending power thus those losses up to 50% of the company gross can be wrote off as business expense and 3000 dollars Annually for everybody else rolling credit! Final Message Talk to dfs about the rest, BitShekel Has An umbrella contract called Achen.. A Hebrew Acronym Al Khanepee Nesheriim! From the bible, As On The Wings Of A Great Eagle!!! This is Your Ark.. We Have another level in Yisrael I Have to pass on savings to my house!!! So thus as there is a Public and a business buy-in rate where one floats the other Achen...
